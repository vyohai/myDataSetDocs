Introduction
------------
This repo is responsible for:

* Presentation of the "GetUp-Dataset"
* Pre-processing of the "GetUp-Dataset"
* Analisys of the raw and the pre-processed data
* creating diffrent flavours of datasets based on the main one( only young or only old etc.)
* supply the chosen dataset for external processing code 

GetUp-Dataset experiments
-------------------------
**Intro**
The goal of the experiments was to enable research and development
in the field of remote functional assesment, mainly for elders.

**Protocol**
In order to measure and analyze natural sit-stand-transitions, we asked the subjects to sit in a room with a chair and a table with 15 objects on It.
Subjects were asked to stand up from the chair and move one object to a different place at their own time.
They had 20 minutes for the task of moving all 15 elements.
The experiment was videotaped using a GoPro camera.
The movement of the subject was measured by two IMU sensors, one on the subject’s hand and one on the subject’s pelvis as depicted in figure 1.  
The experiment was approved by an ethical review board and all participants signed a consent document.

**Hardware**
To measure the subject movements, we used MMR modules from MBIENTLAB.

Tutorials and notebooks
-----------------------
in the /notebooks/ directory we have the following tutorials/notebooks:

1. **Tutorial1_Reading_single_subject_data.ipynb**- show how to load preprocessed data with the repo code
	https://app.reviewnb.com/vyohai/myDataSet/blob/main/notebooks%2FTutorial1_Reading_single_subject_data.ipynb

2. **Tutorial2_Analisys_of_walking_direction_by_hand_sensor.ipynb**(under construction) - summerize the analisys of a simple scenario 
(getting up--> walking-->sitting down), maunly spectral analysis of the different phases.

Leading questions
-----------------
**Basic experiments data**

1. how many subjects

2. how many evevnts(total and for each subject)

3. TUG scores

4. Camera frame-rate

5. Camera based sit-to-stand times

6. Sensors frame-rate

7. Subjects ages
		
**Basic sensor analisys**

1. Calculated features

2. diffrent features metrices: max/min/peaks mean...
		
**Events basic analisys**

1. How does an event looks on each feature

2. Comperison of diffrent events for the same subject

3. Comperison of diffrent events for diffrent subjects

		
**Events spectral analisys**

1. Spectral analisys of one event

2. Spectral analisys of not events

3. Spectral analisys  comperison for diffrent events for the same subject

4. Spectral analisys  comperison for diffrent events for diffrent subjects
		
**STFT analisys**

1. can we make events in hand measurements more recognizble?
	
**Filtering**

1. Basic filter noises

2. Adaptive filtering

3. Event based filters(such as ZUPT)
		
**Create new features**

1. Can we use walking direction
